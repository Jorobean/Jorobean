<h1>Modern Trends in Footwear Design</h1>

<p>
Footwear is shifting toward customization and bold visuals.
More brands are experimenting with sculpted shapes, one-piece construction, and digital manufacturing.
3D printing plays a major role by allowing designers to break away from the limits of traditional methods.
</p>

<p>
Another trend is the rise of sustainable materials.
Buyers are paying closer attention to how their shoes are made and where the materials come from.
Environmentally friendly processes are becoming more important across the industry.
</p>

<p>
The growth of artistic footwear is also creating space for brands like Jorobean.
People want shoes that express style in new ways, which opens doors for more experimental and creative designs.
