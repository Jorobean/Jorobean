<h1>How to Care for 3D Printed Shoes</h1>

<p>
3D printed shoes last longer when they’re cleaned gently with warm water and mild soap.
A soft brush removes dirt without damaging the material.
After cleaning, let the shoes air dry to keep the structure firm and flexible.
</p>

<p>
Storing them in a cool, dry place helps the material maintain its shape.
Avoid leaving them in very hot areas, because heat can soften the printed structure.
</p>

<p>
If the shoes ever get worn down, the material can be recycled or reprinted.
This makes them easier to refresh and extend their lifespan.
